The first time the user starts the application, a root user must be created, for this, he only has to click on the button
 `Create a New User` 


{% include image.html file="azzets/user/button_CNUser.png" alt="Create User" %}


Then we fill in the form that appears:


{% include image.html file="azzets/user/user_register.png" alt="User Register" %}


*Username*: This is the username with which we will later access this application. In this case we will put a valid email address.  

*Password*: We introduce a password (if it is secure, better) to be able to access the application. The password security level is displayed below.  

*Confirm Password*: It is the confirmation of the previous field "Password". We re-enter our password to avoid mistakes.  

To finish with the registration we press the blue button `Register`, which will take us to a new window, it tells us that we must go to our email and confirm our registration.

Once this is done, the new user will be created in our database and will have access to use the application. Clicking on the link in the email will take you directly to the application confirmation window, where you will only have to log in and we are ready to use Azzets !!!

## Have you forgotten your password?
In case of forgetting our password, we click on the `orange button`, enter our email address and click on reset password.

 {% include image.html file="azzets/user/send-email-reset.png" alt="Orange Button" %} 

This action will send an email with a url to our email, when selecting it we get a new window with the option to put a new password, when we are satisfied with the new password we click on the blue button `Validate New Password`  

{% include image.html file="azzets/user/change-pass.png" alt="Orange Button" %}   

Then we just have to log in, for them we click on `Sing In` and enter our data, at the end we click on `Sing In`:
